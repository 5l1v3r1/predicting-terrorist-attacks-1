# Predicting Terrorism Attacks

Using the [Global Terrorism Database](http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/) and scikit-learn,
I compared the effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms in
predicting where and when terrorist attacks would occur.
This was done as part of a project for PHYS 416 (Computational Physics) at
Rice University.
